# Distribution Zoo
A C++ library for probability distributions.

The aim of the Distribution Zoo is to be a simple and comprehensive header-only library for probability distributions.

To get going, simply put the relevant header file into your project:

## Continuous Univariate Distributions

The header file [continuous_univariate/continuous_univariate.hpp](continuous_univariate/continuous_univariate.hpp) defines the following methods:

- `pdf`
- `log_pdf`

on the following distributions:

- Normal
- Beta

## Discrete Univariate Distributions

Coming soon.
